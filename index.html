<p>Dear fellow filmmakers from all over the world,</p>
<p>Since the corona virus broke out around the globe, the MIFF committee has been closely following the progressing trend of the international film industry. In the time of constant changing, we think about all the filmmakers out there and where we will go next. We have been waiting for a time to restart everything and looking forward to holding the film festival this year as we planned.</p>
<p>Now despite that the shooting and film making condition in many regions or countries are still very limited, we have received film entries for the festival from filmmakers all over the world. We never stopped working and have been watching these film entries. We do not want to and we will not fail the hard work those filmmakers have put in there. Knowing that, the MIFF committee will carefully consider and choose the awards this year, and we give you all, who love films and put such effort for making your film in this difficult time, our greatest respect. We know how hard it is to continue working in this industry under the big environment, not to mention completing an independent film and/ or art films. It is your passion, piece by piece, that kept the industry still alive.</p>
<p>Due to the virus, after the MIFF committee has carefully discussed, there will be no live/ in-person events of the 2020 MIFF. However, for the love and passion we have for film, for the respect we hold for the filmmakers, we decide that we will keep the award giving online this year. December 11th, 2020 will be the award ceremony of the 2020 MIFF. We will post the awarded film list and awarded individual/group list online. We welcome more filmmakers to join us in the festival to support the progress of independent films and art films and help film return to art.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Film returns to art instead of being commercial&rdquo; has been the eternal theme of the MIFF. This year we encourage more films, which bring the audiences the power of thinking with a stylish artistry, to join the festival.</p>
<p>In this special time, we hope that the filmmakers from all the world can help and support each other. Do not give up your dream. Do not let that fire in your heart die. Although not everyone is able to go out there and shoot films, everyone can use this time to learn more,</p>
<p>to write more and to create more. While we are waiting for the waking of filmmaking, writers can write more scripts, directors can draw your storyboards, and the producers can keep communicating with other film people out there through online meetings...</p>
<p>We keep working. We never say stop. That&rsquo;s who we are&mdash;filmmakers. December 11th, 2020, we look forward to seeing your name on the list!</p>
<p>Thank you for your support and sincere wishes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
